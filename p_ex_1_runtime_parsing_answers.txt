What kind of error handling would you implement?
Firstly, we have to check if the json file entered in the program exists and can be opened.
In order to check the validity of parsing, we can check if the data loaded from json is a dictionary.
It would be suitable to validate if each instance contains expected keys and the values are of a valid data type for each key.



What should be done about invalid entries?
IF the entries are invalid, we can exclude them from our data.
We could also speculate about the intended value and correct these values, but it is rather risky and certainly not suitable
for sensitive data.
