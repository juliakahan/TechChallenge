What kind of error handling would you implement?
Error handling when user inputs invalid data, that is:
 -the number of points smaller than three, including negative numbers
 -the number of points is not an integer
 -the number of points is not a number

How to validate that the triangle is valid?
 -based on the triangle inequality theorem, the sum of two sides must be grater than the third one
 -all of the three points cannot be collinear

How to speed up the algorithm to avoid calculating all possible combinations?
 We can try using Delaunay triangulation algorithm.
 It is a greedy algorithm that starts with dividing the set of points into
 triangles in such a way that no point is inside the circumcircle of any triangle. We can combine in with divine and conquer algorithm.
 We can divide the set of points into two subsets and then combine the results.
 Meriging the results can be done obtaining the final running time of O(n log n).
